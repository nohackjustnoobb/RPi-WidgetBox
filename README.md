# RPi WidgetBox

RPi WidgetBox is a simple desktop widget application designed primarily for Raspberry Pi and other small-screen devices. However, it can run on any device that supports a modern web browser.

Features

- Lightweight & flexible—runs on low-power devices
- Plugin-based system—comes with no built-in widgets, allowing full customization
- Cross-platform—works on Raspberry Pi, PCs, and more

To use the application, you'll need to add plugins. Several common plugins are available, including a fullscreen clock, weather widget. Check out the [RPi-WidgetBox-Plugins](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/RPi-WidgetBox-Plugins) repository for more details.
